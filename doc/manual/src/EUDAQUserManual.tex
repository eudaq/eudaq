\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
\noindent
This document provides an overview of the EUDAQ software framework,
the data acquisition framework originally developed for use by the
EUDET-type beam telescopes~\cite{telescopesWiki}.
It describes how to install and run the DAQ system and use many of the included utility programs,
and how users may integrate their DAQ systems into the EUDAQ framework
by writing their own: Producer, for integrating the data stream into the acquisition; DataCollector, for merging the muiltple data streams and writing to disk; and DataConverter, for converting data for offline analysis.
