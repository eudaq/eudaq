You need to add the driver location as a variable to cmake with

cd <<EUDAQ_ROOT>>/build
cmake -DBUILD_palpidefs=on -DCMAKE_PALPIDEFS_DRIVER_INCLUDE:FILEPATH=<<DRIVER LOCATION>> -DUSE_TINYXML=on -DUSE_ROOT=on ../
make install

You need to install tinyxml libusb-1.0-0 and unbuffer (Ubuntu package: libtinyxml-dev expect-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev)
ROOT is needed for the S-Curve scan analysis in the converter

Compile pALPIDEfs-software with 'make lib'
